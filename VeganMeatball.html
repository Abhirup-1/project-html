      <p>In a bowl, combine 1 cup of cooked lentils, ½ cup of breadcrumbs, ¼ cup of finely chopped onion, 2 minced garlic cloves, and 2 tablespoons of ground flaxseeds mixed with 6 tablespoons of water (flax egg).
        Add 1 teaspoon of dried oregano, 1 teaspoon of dried basil, ½ teaspoon of paprika, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix well to combine.
        Shape the mixture into small balls, about 1 inch in diameter, and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
        Bake the vegan meatballs in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 20-25 minutes or until they are golden brown.
        Meanwhile, heat your favorite marinara sauce in a separate pot.
        Serve the vegan meatballs with the marinara sauce over pasta or in a sub sandwich. Enjoy your delicious vegan meatball dish!
